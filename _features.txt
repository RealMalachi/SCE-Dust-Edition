SONIC CLEAN ENGINE: DUST EDITION

SCED is an upgraded version of SCE, which, honestly, is going through a bit of a feature creep. For the sake of keeping track of all of this, I think it's best to document its features, especially the new ones





; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controller types

3-button controller
- The standard, not much to say.

6-button controller (optional)
- code adjusts between 3pad and 6pad handling automatically
- fixed bug with 3pad activating 6pad inputs when pressing up and down (notable example being SOR3)
- ISSUE: Unlike other options, disabling 6pad still keeps its RAM space and code

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SRAM (optional)
- Contains a word-sized checksum, 8 letter string, byte-sized version number, and an additional byte which may see later use
- If string isn't there, init SRAM
- If checksum fails, it loads a backup onto the main SRAM
- If version number is an older version, convert SRAM to new type. If a newer version, do... something.

I highly advise that final versions of a game only revise SRAM when absolutely necessary
Currently no debug versions of SRAM,

Planned features

Multitap (4WayPlay and/or Multitap, 4 player planned only)
Keyboard controllers (XBand and/or Saturn Keyboard. Converts configurable inputs into 6pad controls, rather then true keyboard support)
Wifi (MegaWifi and/or Retro.Link)
