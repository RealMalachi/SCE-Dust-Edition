Maintainance

Fix a lot of a4-a6 register errors with players
Make sound driver calls more module
Made audio from addons more module
Make SRAM easier to work with
Remove 6pad related code when 6pad is disabled (more macros yeah...)

Proper documentation on smaller engine changes
- Merged object address and routine
Emulator enhancements spreadsheet
Emulator speedups

Expand hardware checks
- Add more emulators to the list (clownmdemu)
- Flashcart detection
- Test and enhance console frame speed check
- Implement console revision check
- Detect hardware mods
- V30 60Hz by beloved
- CRAM dot inaccuracy speedups

Features

Easier code and data file compression


Improved Render_Sprites
- If hardware can't render any more sprites but has objects to check are onscreen, use heavily simplified check
- Better support for non-object sprite rendering, such as the rings and HUD
- ren_wordframe: Word-sized mapping_frame option, at the cost of the render box (height_pixels) being limited to a square
- ren_excessive: Ignores height_pixels check. Individual sprite bounds checked during rendering process, if out of bounds don't render. If any sprites render, set ren_onscreen


Better PAL support
- V30 (allow V30 60Hz on emulation)
- Figure out convenient method for 50Hz retiming to 60-ish speeds
- PAL60 if possible


MegaWifi and Retro.Link support
https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw
https://github.com/b1tsh1ft3r/retro.link
- Find a way to contact MegaWifi dev, to get asm version
- If possible, cross-play between these different types
- for bigger data, maybe make the game compress its data? It's a long shot though


More controller support
- EA and Sega MultiTap -
- Xband keyboard if I can - https://github.com/Cinghialotto/xband/blob/master/Keyboard.zip
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cVtJnv0XdEhLINv73P13DpBlyvhprZpw
- Saturn keyboard - https://plutiedev.com/saturn-keyboard
- RetroLink keyboard if that happens
- Should probably also get mouse support - 


Piracy checks? I don't want to stop players playing the game though, just a disclaimer
- If the ROM detects mappers, SRAM, or enhancement chips it shouldn't have
- If the ROM size is more then expected


Expand on MCD Mode 1 capabilities
- RF5C68 support (the SNES-like sound chip). Sonic CD serves as a good reference, see https://github.com/DevsArchive/sonic-cd-disassembly/tree/main/Sound%20Drivers


Experiment with SMS OPLL support on Megadrive
