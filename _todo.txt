Maintainance

Make SRAM easier to work with
Remove 6pad related code when 6pad is disabled (more macros yeah...)
Proper documentation on smaller engine changes
- Merged object address and routine

Features

Improved Render_Sprites
- If hardware can't render any more sprites but has objects to check are onscreen, use heavily simplified check
- Better support for non-object sprite rendering, such as the rings and HUD
- ren_wordframe: Word-sized mapping_frame option, at the cost of the render box (height_pixels) being limited to a square
- ren_excessive: Ignores height_pixels check. Individual sprite bounds checked during rendering process, if out of bounds don't render. If any sprites render, set ren_onscreen

Better PAL support
- V30
- 50Hz retiming to emulate 60Hz
- Real PAL60 if possible


MegaWifi and Retro.Link support
https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw
https://github.com/b1tsh1ft3r/retro.link
- Find a way to contact MegaWifi dev, to get asm version
- If possible, cross-play between these different types
- for bigger data, maybe make the game compress its data? It's a long shot though

More controller support

Console revision and Emulator checks, to lock or rework certain features that would have unintentional effects, or ease CPU when inaccurate emulation can benefit
inaccurate MCD emulation could allow better looping, for instance
https://github.com/DevsArchive/genesis-emulator-detector
- BCD flag accuracy
- TAS on RAM


Piracy checks? I don't want to stop players playing the game though, just a disclaimer
- If the game doesn't have SRAM and succeeds a write
