Maintainance

Make SRAM easier to work with
Remove 6pad related code when 6pad is disabled (more macros yeah...)
Proper documentation on smaller engine changes
- Merged object address and routine
Emulator enhancements spreadsheet
Emulator speedups

Features

Improved Render_Sprites
- If hardware can't render any more sprites but has objects to check are onscreen, use heavily simplified check
- Better support for non-object sprite rendering, such as the rings and HUD
- ren_wordframe: Word-sized mapping_frame option, at the cost of the render box (height_pixels) being limited to a square
- ren_excessive: Ignores height_pixels check. Individual sprite bounds checked during rendering process, if out of bounds don't render. If any sprites render, set ren_onscreen


Better PAL support
- V30 (allow V30 60Hz on emulation)
- Figure out convenient method for 50Hz retiming to 60-ish speeds
- PAL60 if possible


MegaWifi and Retro.Link support
https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw
https://github.com/b1tsh1ft3r/retro.link
- Find a way to contact MegaWifi dev, to get asm version
- If possible, cross-play between these different types
- for bigger data, maybe make the game compress its data? It's a long shot though


More controller support

Console revision and emulator checks, to lock or rework certain features that would have unintentional effects, or ease CPU when inaccurate emulation can benefit
https://github.com/DevsArchive/genesis-emulator-detector, BCD flags accuracy, TAS on RAM
Requirements
- Emulator/Clone check
- Flashcart detection (Everdrive could be used for multi-threading)
- Console speed check (S3Ks poorly named "Detect_PAL" is a good start)
- Console revision check (at least enough to determine TAS)

Advantages
- load an error screen when you know the emulator doesn't support certain features, like mappers or wifi
- better redbook audio looping
- V30 60Hz by beloved
- less Z80 pauses; higher quality PCM
- CRAM dot inaccuracy speedups


Piracy checks? I don't want to stop players playing the game though, just a disclaimer
- If the game doesn't have SRAM and succeeds a write
- If the ROM size is more then expected

Expand on MCD Mode 1 support. Ideally should only be for enhancements, such as multi-threading 3D rendering
