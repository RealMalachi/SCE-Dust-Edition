Maintainance

Make SRAM easier to work with
Remove 6pad related code when 6pad is disabled (more macros yeah...)

Features

Better PAL support
- V30
- 50Hz retiming to emulate 60Hz
- Real PAL60 if possible


MegaWifi and Retro.Link support
https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw
https://github.com/b1tsh1ft3r/retro.link
- If possible, cross-play between these different types
- for bigger data, maybe make the game do compression?

More controller support

Console revision and Emulator checks, to lock or rework certain features that would have unintentional effects, or ease CPU when inaccurate emulation can benefit
inaccurate MCD emulation could allow better looping, for instance
https://github.com/DevsArchive/genesis-emulator-detector
- BCD flag accuracy
- TAS on RAM


Piracy checks? I don't want to stop players playing the game though, just a disclaimer
- If the game doesn't have SRAM and succeeds a write
